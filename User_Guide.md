# Welcome to the Louply AI Assistant User Guide!

This guide will help you understand the various ways you can interact with our AI-driven AI Assistant to make the most out of your experience. From answering general work-related questions to providing insights on tasks, our AI Assistant is here to assist you. Let's explore some of the primary use cases and scenarios:

## Asking work-related questions with linked sources

Louply AI Assistant can search through all your linked sources, such as Notion, Google Drive, or Confluence, to find answers related to your work.

**Example:**

>[!badge variant="info" icon=":person:" text="Question"] Can you find me the project deadline from our Confluence documentation?
>
>[!badge variant="info" icon=":octopus:" iconAlign="right" text="Louply AI Assistant"] The project deadline is on May 25th, 2023. Source: https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Project/pages/123456/Project+Deadlines


## Asking general questions unrelated to your work

Our AI Assistant can also help you with general questions that are not directly related to your work, such as improving a specific SQL query. It will use its general knowledge to create an answer and may provide a relevant external source.

**Example:**

>User: How can I optimize this SQL query for better performance? SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;
>
>AI Assistant: To optimize the SQL query, consider adding an index on the 'age' column and selecting only necessary columns instead of '*'. For more optimization tips, check this resource: https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-performance-tips/

## Assigning tasks to create content

Louply AI Assistant can assist you in creating various content types such as programs, descriptions, or policies.

**Example:**

>User: Can you help me write a brief privacy policy for our website?
>
>AI Assistant: Sure, here's a sample privacy policy outline for your website:
>
>1. Introduction
>2. Information Collection and Use

>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

## Specifying an internal system for information

If you want the AI Assistant to search for information from a specific linked system, simply specify the system in your question.

**Example:**

>User: Find me the latest sales report from our Notion workspace.
>
>AI Assistant: The latest sales report shows a 15% increase in revenue for Q1 2023 compared to Q4 2022. You can view the full report here: https://www.notion.so/yourcompany/Latest-Sales-Report-Q1-2023-abcdef123456
